# Computer-Case-Mod-Design
This repository contains my Computer Case Design projects for the SkillsUSA competitions for Both District and State. 
These are the journals that have all of the project details. These journals contain pictures, budgeting, meeting summaries, and more. 
I Had an opportunity to work with some Teams along with getting some experience with planning and budgeting.
